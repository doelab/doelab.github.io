# EE4449 Logic Design and Logic Synthesis Lab

Labs for EE4449 Logic Design/Logic Synthesis Course at HCMUT

## Introduction and Rules

The EE4449 course focuses on logic design and logic synthesis, providing students with hands-on experience in designing, simulating, and synthesizing digital circuits. 

- Conduct in group of 2. DO NOT COPY ANYONE. COPY = 0
- File your reports with details: How you did it, why? Test cases, Real Pictures that you took of the kit with a piece of paper containg the dates + Students IDs.
- Reports will be graded and there will be a seperate date for interview grading/demonstration.
- Do not miss more than 1 reports
- Missing deadlines would damage your score.
- Submit your files on LMS. DO NOT EMAIL ME.

Suggestion is you start your lab early before the deadline. The labs are designed so that you cannot complete it in a day (except lab 1). DO NOT WAIT UNTIL DEADLINE TO DO IT. Each Lab would cost ~25 days.
