# EE3041 DSP on FPGA Big Project

## Objective and Overview

The big project contains many parts. This is for you to apply the knowledge surrounding the course to a real-world problem. You will be given a set of requirements and you will need to design, implement, and test a solution.

This is a **group** project, to be done on your Altera DE10 board.

Note: Do **NOT** use IP CATALOG for this lab.

## Schedule and Scoring

If you have not uploaded anything by the drop-dead date, we will assume you are no longer in the course. Why? Because the syllabus says you must attempt the big project. Not uploading anything and not showing up to explain what you’ve done is not attempting the project — see the syllabus for details.

Scoring shall be based on the following criteria:

- Percentage of the project completed
- Quality of the design
- Quality of the report
- Quality of the presentation
- Quality of the demo
- Your understanding of the project

## A Note about Collaboration

Big project is to be accomplished in groups. All work must be from your own team members.

Hints from others can be of great help, both to the hinter and the hintee.  
Thus, discussions and hints about the assignment are encouraged. However, the project must be coded and written up in groups (you may not show, nor view, any source code from other students’ groups). We may use automated tools to detect copying.

Use Emails/LMS to ask questions or come visit us (203B3) during office hours.  
We want to see you succeed, but you have to ask for help.

## Project Overview

Some part of the big project is **Simulation** only, however, your synthesis result on Quartus for the DE10 Kit still affects your credit, so code should be synthesizable to resources/timing.

- [Part 1: FIR Filter]({% post_url 2024-09-14-DSPonFPGALab1 %})
- Part 2: IIR Filter (TBA)
- Part 3: Wave Generator (TBA)
- Part 4: Oscilloscope (TBA)

## For Credit

You will present your project to the class. You will demonstrate your project to the class. You will submit a report on your project to LMS.

### For Extra Credit

Lab 3 and 4 could be demonstrated for real on the DE10 board. If you do this, you will receive extra credit. (Email me to borrow the 3.5mm to BNC cable, or you could buy it yourself).

## Some Other Things You Should Learn

## How To Turn In Your Solution

This semester we will be using LMS, simply submit the zip file with your reports and codes.

## Demos and Late Penalty

We will have demo / presentation times on of class times on or near the due date. Since we will demo from the files in your zip, it is possible that you’ll demo on a following day.

**Define Late:** Lateness is determined by the file dates of your submission on LMS.
