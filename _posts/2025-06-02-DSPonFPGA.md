# EE3041 DSP on FPGA Big Project

## Objective and Overview

The big project contains many parts. This is for you to apply the knowledge surrounding the course to a real-world problem. You will be given a set of requirements and you will need to design, implement, and test a solution.

This is a **group** project, to be done on either DE10 Standard Development Kit or DE2 Standard Development Kit (students are free to choose).

Note: Do **NOT** use IP CATALOG for this lab.

## Schedule and Scoring

If you have not uploaded anything by the drop-dead date, we will assume you are no longer in the course. Why? Because the syllabus says you must attempt the big project. Not uploading anything and not showing up to explain what you’ve done is not attempting the project — see the syllabus for details.

Scoring shall be based on the following criteria:

- Percentage of the project completed
- Quality of the design
- Quality of the report
- Quality of the presentation
- Quality of the demo
- Your understanding of the project

## A Note about Collaboration

Big project is to be accomplished in groups. All work must be from your own team members.

Hints from others can be of great help, both to the hinter and the hintee.  
Thus, discussions and hints about the assignment are encouraged. However, the project must be coded and written up in groups (you may not show, nor view, any source code from other students’ groups). We may use automated tools to detect copying.

Use Emails/LMS to ask questions or come visit us (203B3) during office hours.  
We want to see you succeed, but you have to ask for help.

- [Part 2: FIR and IIR Filters]({% post_url 2025-02-06-DSPonFPGALab2 %})
- [Part 3: Audio Equalizer]({% post_url 2025-02-06-DSPonFPGALab3 %})

## For Credit

You will present your project to the class. You will demonstrate your project to the class. You will submit a report on your project to LMS.

## How To Turn In Your Solution

This semester we will be using LMS, simply submit the zip file with your reports and codes.

## Demos and Late Penalty

We will have demo / presentation times on of class times on or near the due date. Since we will demo from the files in your zip, it is possible that you’ll demo on a following day.

**Define Late:** Lateness is determined by the file dates of your submission on LMS.
